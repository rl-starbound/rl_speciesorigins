    "A Novakid Introduction

Easily the most enigmatic of the known races, the Novakid are glowing gaseous beings in humanoid shape, with metallic \"brands\" where their faces would be. A generally carefree and capricious people with notoriously short memories and attention spans, they live in the moment, wandering the stars in search of adventure, with little reflection on the past. So unconcerned are they with what happened before now, they have forgotten their own origins, having",
    "never bothered to catalog their history. Thus where they came from and how they were formed may forever be a mystery.

As they have largely kept themselves out of interstellar affairs, Novakid are something of a rare sight in the universe."
