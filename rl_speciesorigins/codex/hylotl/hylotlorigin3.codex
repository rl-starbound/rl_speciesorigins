    "Dearest Hylotl missionary,

You have gone out into the great wide world to spread the glory of our species, and to help those less fortunate than ourselves. For this, we thank you.

May the Hylotl spread peace throughout the universe. Be discerning. Be polite. And remember Directive 0451. We must gather knowledge and shoulder its weight, for knowledge is truth, and truth brings enlightenment. We will bring that",
    "enlightenment to the others and, in time, they too will share in our peace."
