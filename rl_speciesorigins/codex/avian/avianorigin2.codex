    "Aeons ago, Avian-kind existed beyond time and space, traveling through the Aether with their winged god, Kluex. Without fear of death or decay, they were free to watch the unfolding of the universe. But, their bliss would not last forever.

The Avians watched with amusement as the mortals lived their short lives, and yet the mortals experienced feelings of which the Avians knew not. Driven by envy, the Avians crossed into the mortal realm to experience these emotions for themselves. This",
    "was the original sin of Avian-kind.

Having turned their backs on the heavens, Kluex stripped the Avians of their ethereal wings, dooming them to walk the mortal plane. For generations, Avians fought amongst themselves, until they were united by the Stargazers with faith in the absolution offered by Kluex. The only thing Kluex demanded in exchange for absolution was a little sacrifice."
