    "To our Apex comrades, the Resistance is counting on you. Even now, the Miniknog descend on our secret bases. In our darkest hour, we rely on you to continue the fight against tyranny.

Go now, brave Apex. Go, spread the plight of our people to the universe at large. Call for help! Return with an army so that we may crush the Miniknog once and for all! And pick up some bananas on your way back. Just be sure not to run out of fuel."
