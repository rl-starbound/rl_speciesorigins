    "An Apex Introduction

From as far back as Apex history can be traced, all that is known is the rule of the majestic Big Ape and his benevolent Miniknog. Of course, Apex history only reaches back about one hundred years, due to a series of accidental fires, explosions and rogue mech accidents which destroyed all of the archives ever built.

Big Ape assures the populace, however, that he has been in charge since the dawn of time, and will",

    "continue to be in charge until the last star goes supernova. Any Apex who steps out of line, says the wrong thing, eats the wrong banana, or looks at one of the many hidden cameras in a funny way will be subjected to Miniknog therapy, designed to improve the species. In fact, all Apex should volunteer for this. Sign up now."
